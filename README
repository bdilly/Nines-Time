Nines Time is a game about digit 9 tyranny over the other digits.

You are a 6 undercovered for years studying the 9s and providing information
for your HQ so you could stop them, but your arms fail after years of handplant
and you need to survive for 9 minutes until your pals rescue you.

What's your weapon? Math, dude! You need to operate the number trying
to get you.

It's a game developed in python using bindings for EFL (Enlightnment Foundation
Libraries), so to play it you'll need to install python-ecore, python-evas,
python-edje and python-emotion that can be get from "e" project repository:

  svn co http://svn.enlightenment.org/svn/e/trunk/BINDINGS/python/

Info available at:

  http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/Python


To build the theme, run build_theme.sh.

Good luck ;)
